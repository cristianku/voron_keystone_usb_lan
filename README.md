# BTT_CANBUS
This is a modified version of the voron 2.4 rear skirt, for the keystone installation.

## Since the USB keystone inserts from amazon where not fitting, the hole in the original skirt is too big, i have modified until i was satisfied of the result ( can be easily inserted and removed , while keeping a good hold in place )


## This what i am using, but i guess they are all the same  https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07Z9446ZR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

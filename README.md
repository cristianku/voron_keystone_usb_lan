This is a modified version of the voron 2.4 rear skirt, for the keystone installation.

Since the USB keystone inserts from amazon where not fitting, the hole in the original skirt is too big, i have modified until i was satisfied of the result ( can be easily inserted and removed , while keeping a good hold in place )


this what i am using, but i guess they are all the same  https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07Z9446ZR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

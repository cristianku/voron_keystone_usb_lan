# Modified Voron 2.4 Rear Skirt for Keystone Installation

This is an adapted version of the Voron 2.4 rear skirt, specifically modified for keystone installation.

## Modification Details
The original skirt's opening was too large for the USB keystone inserts I purchased from Amazon. To address this, I modified the opening until I achieved a satisfactory fit. The keystone can now be easily inserted and removed, while maintaining a secure hold.

## Keystone Insert Used
The specific keystone insert I am using can be found here: [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07Z9446ZR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). However, I believe the design should be compatible with similar inserts.
